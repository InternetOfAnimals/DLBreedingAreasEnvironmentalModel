# DesertLocustBreedingModel

This is a data science project. It investigates  the "sixth sense" of storks, environmental factors, and complementary data to detect desert locust breading areas in an early stage of development to prevent outbreaks. A classification model is built using scikit-learn algorithms and Random Forest and an MLN. 

These models are used in the Desert Locust Breeding Alarm Service to monitor relevant factors and detect breeding risk areas in near real-time.
