# DLBreedingAreasEnvironmentalModel

This project investigates if whites storks on their migration to their wintering grounds can help to find desert locust breeding areas. White stork routes , environmental factors along these routes, and complementary data are investigated to detect desert locust breeding areas in an early stage of development to prevent outbreaks. A classification model is built using scikit-learn algorithms and Random Forest and an MLN. 

These models are used in the Desert Locust Breeding Alarm Service to monitor relevant factors and detect breeding risk areas in near real-time.
